## üöÄ About Me
As a psychologist, I never expected to find my passion in code. But the moment I delved into backend development, I was hooked. Driven by curiosity and the desire to solve problems, I dedicated myself to learning Django, PostgreSQL, and Django REST Framework. With every project, I found myself increasingly inspired by the challenge of building efficient, secure, and scalable applications.

Here, you‚Äôll see some of the projects I‚Äôve crafted‚Äîeach one an opportunity to apply my skills and deepen my understanding of backend design. I‚Äôm excited to bring this dedication and creativity to a team, ready to keep learning and tackling new challenges. Let‚Äôs build something remarkable together! ‚ú®
